# Git Branch

If we think of Git as a timeline of our projects then Branches are alternate universes or alternate timelines where we can make changes to the main project but without affecting it.

If we are happy with the changes we made in our branch then we can merge it with the master branch.

Branches also allow multiple collaborators to work on multiple features, fixes, improvements, etc in the project without breaking the main code or conflicting with other collaborators.
