# Git Fork and Clone

## Forking

To Fork a repo from another account, all we have to do is to search for the repor or account that contains the repo we are interested in, then once in that repo we just click **Fork** button at the top of the Github Page, it will automatically copy / fork that repo into ours.

## Clonning

To Clone, we can do it from our local environment.

1. Create a Directory where to save the Repo and access it.
2. On GitHub click on _Clone or Download_
3. Copy the link (you can use the HTTPS or SSH option)
4. Once copied, run the following command `git clone <link_of_the_repo>`
5. And Voilá!

**NOTE:**
Forking is for contributors
Cloning is for collaborators
