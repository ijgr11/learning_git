# Hello

This is just a repo that contains my notes on learning GIT taken mostly from the [**Git and GitHub: The complete Git and GitHub Course**](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/git-and-github/9781800204003) from George Lomidze, as well as other resources on the internet.

This is for my personal use and learning, so this should not be taken as an official guide for learning GIT, in this case please refer to the official [Git-Scm Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or any other official resources.

Hope you enjoy it and I am open for any update or fix you might believe necessary.

~ Pura Vida!
